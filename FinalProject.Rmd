#Proposal
We would like to explore this data to find what effects if a Kickstarter succeeds, looking at amount of time to pledge, the goal amount, and how it is effected by the category.

#Marginal Distributions

```{r}
ks_data = ks_data %>% separate(launched, into=c("launch_date", "launch_time"), sep = " ") %>% mutate(launch_date = ymd(launch_date), deadline = ymd(deadline), ID = as.factor(ID))
str(ks_data)

```

#Visual summary

#Expanding complexity

```{r}
